The code provided includes several libraries and features. Here's a brief document summarizing the design choices, challenges faced, and the libraries involved:

Design Choices:

Responsive Design: The code is designed to be responsive, ensuring that the website layout adapts to different screen sizes. The use of relative units like "vh" (viewport height) and responsive grid layouts helps achieve this.

Fonts: "Bebas Neue" is chosen for its bold and modern appearance, while "Arial" is used as a fallback font for compatibility.

Color Palette: The color palette includes soft background colors like "#faf4de" to evoke a warm and inviting feel associated with autumn.

Animations: GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform) and ScrollTrigger are implemented for animations. Elements like text and images have dynamic animations to engage users.

Interactivity: A circular reveal effect is created using CSS clip-path for interactive elements like buttons. The reveal effect responds to user interaction for an engaging user experience.

Challenges Faced:

Responsive Design: Designing for multiple screen sizes while maintaining the desired visual layout can be challenging. Relative units and CSS Grid are used to make the design responsive.

Complex Animations: Implementing animations, like random rotation and position of images, requires fine-tuning in GSAP. Achieving a smooth, interactive circular reveal effect also posed challenges.

Image Loading: The code does not include dynamic image loading. Integrating a system to load images from a source dynamically would be a valuable addition.

Additional Features and Tools Implemented:

GSAP and ScrollTrigger: These libraries are used to create dynamic animations throughout the webpage. Images in the "Autumn images" section have random rotation and position effects for added visual appeal.

Lenis Smooth Scrolling: The Lenis library is integrated for smooth scrolling animations, enhancing the overall user experience.

Circular Reveal Effect: The website features a circular reveal effect that responds to user interaction, adding an interactive element to the design.

Split-Type Text Animation: While the code hints at its use, the Split-Type library could be implemented for further text animations and transitions, enhancing the site's visual appeal.

Image Display: The website's design is suitable for displaying autumn-themed images. The code could be extended to load and display images from a source for a complete and practical project.

Libraries Involved:
The libraries involved in the code include:

GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform): Used for various animations and transitions.
ScrollTrigger: A GSAP plugin for triggering animations on scroll.
Lenis: A library for smooth scrolling and interaction detection.
